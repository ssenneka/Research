# Research

This is my Repository for all research code, designs, and schematics.

I am a 3rd year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. 
My focus is in neural engineering and I aim to develop sensory prosthetics that
mimic how natural sensation is integrated in the brain as well as have the
capability to replace lost senses.
